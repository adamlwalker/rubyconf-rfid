## Tagging your world with RFID
Presentations, Demo's, drivers and code from my Rubyconf 2015 talk.

> Come learn all the wonderful uses of UHF RFID tags and how Ruby makes it easy to read, write and deploy real time asset tracking systems. RFID tags can be read from 30 or more feet away and easily integrated with a variety of existing systems with a low barrier to entry. By the end of this session, you'll learn how to track your pets, clothes, keys, and even make a tool that assists with your grocery shopping.
